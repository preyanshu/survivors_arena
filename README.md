# SURVIVAL ARENA

*The Testing Facility was not always a place of death. Decades ago, it stood as the primary research and development center for corporate military technology. Now it serves a darker purpose — drawing in operators with promises of advanced technology and weapons. You are the Operator — and the facility is your proving ground.*

## Core Features

### Diverse Weapon Arsenal

Plasma Sidearms. Scattershot Launchers. Plasma Snipers. HF Blades. Plasma Cannons. Each weapon class handles differently — find the ones that fit your playstyle.

*Some weapons are Standard. Some are Prototype. Some are so rare that most operators will never see them.*

### Five Rarity Tiers

**Standard → Advanced → Elite → Superior → Prototype**

Higher rarity means better stats. Prototype weapons are game-changers. And there are whispers of weapons that only exist in Prototype form...

### Daily Supply Cache

Every 24 hours, access a Supply Cache and mint a random weapon NFT. You might get something ordinary. You might get something that changes everything.

**Test your luck. Every. Single. Day.**

### The Corporate Hostiles

The facility is filled with hostile corporate units — each with their own mechanics, behaviors, and threats. Cyber Drones rush you with explosive cores. Stalker Units track you with plasma weapons. Warlord Class mechs deploy defensive fields. Shadow Units... you'll have to discover yourself.

*The deeper you go, the more you'll encounter.*

### Combat Protocols

The operators who fell before you left behind fragments of their combat data. Find them. Unlock them. Use them to turn the tide.

Nanomachine Barriers that block everything. Plasma Fields that burn all around you. Overdrive Protocols that nothing can match. Nanomachine Enhancements that triple your damage. And more waiting to be discovered.

*Each protocol is a legacy. Each legacy has a story.*

### Loot Drops

Health. Ammo. Armor. The arena provides — if you can survive long enough to collect.

### NFT Weapon Ownership

Every weapon is an NFT on OneChain. Mint it. Own it. Transfer it. Trade it.

Your inventory lives in your wallet — not on our servers.

### Achievement Badges

Hit milestones. Mint proof. Show off your operator credentials with on-chain achievement NFTs.



### Weekly Updates

New hostile units. New weapons. New mechanics. The facility evolves every week with fresh content — there's always something new to discover, master, and collect.

**Expect new enemy types, weapons, and mechanics regularly.**
