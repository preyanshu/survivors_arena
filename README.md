*The Grand Colosseum of Valdris has fallen. The Dark Corruption has consumed the kingdom. You are the last survivor — and the arena is your proving ground.*

## What Is Survival Arena?

A high-intensity action shooter built on **OneChain**.

Fight through endless hordes of corrupted enemies. Unlock powerful abilities inherited from fallen champions. Collect rare and legendary weapons. Open daily chests and test your luck. Build the ultimate arsenal.

**Your skill. Your loot. Your arena.**

## Core Features

### Diverse Weapon Arsenal

Pistols. Shotguns. Rifles. Blades. Full-auto death machines. Each weapon class handles differently — find the ones that fit your playstyle.

*Some weapons are common. Some are legendary. Some are so rare that most players will never see them.*

### Five Rarity Tiers

**Common → Uncommon → Rare → Epic → Legendary**

Higher rarity means better stats. Legendary weapons are game-changers. And there are whispers of weapons that only exist in Legendary form...

### Daily Luck Chest

Every 24 hours, open a chest and mint a random weapon NFT. You might get something ordinary. You might get something that changes everything.

**Test your luck. Every. Single. Day.**

### The Corrupted Horde

The arena is filled with corrupted enemies — each with their own mechanics, behaviors, and threats. Some rush you. Some shoot from afar. Some protect their allies. Some... you'll have to discover yourself.

*The deeper you go, the more you'll encounter.*

### Abilities of the Fallen

The champions who fell before you left behind fragments of their power. Find them. Unlock them. Use them to turn the tide.

Shields that block everything. Flames that burn all around you. Speed that nothing can match. Power that triples your damage. And more waiting to be discovered.

*Each ability is a legacy. Each legacy has a story.*

### Loot Drops

Health. Ammo. Armor. The arena provides — if you can survive long enough to collect.

### NFT Weapon Ownership

Every weapon is an NFT on OneChain. Mint it. Own it. Transfer it. Trade it.

Your inventory lives in your wallet — not on our servers.

### Achievement Badges

Hit milestones. Mint proof. Show off your skill with on-chain achievement NFTs.

### Weekly Updates

New bosses. New weapons. New mechanics. The arena evolves every week with fresh content — there's always something new to discover, master, and collect.

**Expect new bosses, weapons, and mechanics regularly.**

### Marketplace *(Coming Soon)*

Full player-driven economy. Buy weapons you need. Sell duplicates. Trade with the community.
